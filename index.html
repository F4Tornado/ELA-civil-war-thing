    <p style="font-size: 20px">The Civil War revolutionized weaponry and war strategy.</p>
    <p>Many new weapons were created during the civil war, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Artillery</li><br>
      <li>Minefields</li><br>
      <li>Rudimentary flamethrowers</li><br><br><br>
    </ul>
    <p>The new weapons neccesitated new startegies, and old ones disappearing.</p><br><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">The Repeating Rifle and Carbine made frontal assaults on well defended positions obsolete</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">The strategy of breaking the enemies will to keep going was also created.</p>
    <p>This strategy was used in Sherman's march through Georgia, where enormous quantities of infrastructure were destroyed.</p>
